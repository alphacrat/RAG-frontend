I m giving you the description so please create according to the description only

1. there is a main side bar, where there is a home button with a highlighted background of the div
2. then below that with the books icon, it is the custom context that the user can create
3. there is a + icon, from where the contexts can be created
4. then at the bottom there are few icons, but we need only the account part there
5. then comes the main display, the display currently is that of the 2nd context that the user has created and that is the Chem 2A,
6. in each context, we have particular side bar kind of UI, in which the context name, Knowledge and the spaces are there
7. in each context, we can have multiple folders to create
8. for example, if i m a lawyer, then I create a new context of my case - named - Case 1 , in case 1 , we can create mulitple folders - like the prosector folder, then the case folder , then the defence folder and many more
9. for each context we have a knowledge section, where we can upload anything that is necessary for the AI model to know for the particular context

PLease create the UI, as it is given in the code, make it look modern, it is not necessary that we need the same UI for the context created, but the sidebar must be the same , Claude AI also uses the same kind of side bar,
